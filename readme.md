## Real-Time Face Recognition: An End-to-End Project

# 3 Phases

To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:

- Face Detection and Data Gathering
- Train the Recognizer
- Face Recognition
  
The below block diagram resumes those phases:

# Step 1: BoM - Bill of Material
Main parts:

- Raspberry Pi V3 - 
- 5 Megapixels 1080p Sensor OV5647 Mini Camera Video Module

  # Step 2: Installing OpenCV 3 Package

I am using a Raspberry Pi V3 updated to the last version of Raspbian (Stretch), so the best way to have OpenCV installed, is to follow the excellent tutorial developed by Adrian Rosebrock: ![Raspbian Stretch: Install OpenCV 3 + Python on your Raspberry Pi.](https://pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/04/raspbian-stretch-install-opencv-3-python-on-your-raspberry-pi/)

I tried several different guides to install OpenCV on my Pi. Adrian's tutorial is the best. I advise you to do the same, following his guideline step-by-step.

Once you finished Adrian's tutorial, you should have an OpenCV virtual environment ready to run our experiments on your Pi.

Let's go to our virtual environment and confirm that OpenCV 3 is correctly installed.

Let's go to our virtual environment and confirm that OpenCV 3 is correctly installed.

Adrian recommends run the command "source" each time you open up a new terminal to ensure your system variables have been set up correctly.
```
source ~/.profile
```
Next, let's enter on our virtual environment:

```
workon cv
```
If you see the text (cv) preceding your prompt, then you are in the cv virtual environment:

```
(cv) pi@raspberry:~$
```
Now, enter in your Python interpreter:

```
python
```
and confirm that you are running the 3.5 (or above) version.

Inside the interpreter (the ">>>" will appear), import the OpenCV library:

```
import cv2
```
# Step 3: Testing Your Camera
Once you have OpenCV installed in your RPi let's test to confirm that your camera is working properly.

I am assuming that you have a PiCam already installed on your Raspberry Pi.

In case you get an errar like: OpenCV Error: Assertion failed , you can try solve the issue, using the command:

```
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 

```
Once you have all drivers correctly installed, enter the main.py Python code on your IDE.
That code will capture the video stream that will be generated by your PiCam, displaying both, in BGR color and Gray mode.

To execute, enter the command:

```
python main.py
```
To finish the program, you must press the key [ESC] on your keyboard. Click your mouse on the video window, before pressing [ESC].

Some makers found issues when trying to open the camera ( "Assertion failed" error messages). That could happen if the camera was not enabled during OpenCv installation and so, camera drivers did not install correctly. To correct, use the command:

```
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2 

```
# Step 4: Face Detection
